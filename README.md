Multiplayer Checkers GUI

The Game:
Red is the starting color. Players take turns moving their pieces with the end goal being either to eliminate all enemy color checkers or to make it so that the enemy has no more valid moves left. Jumping multiple checkers is allowed, if a checker reaches the opposite end of the board it becomes a "King" checker and has the ability to move (and jump) in the 4 diagonal directions.

Controls:
Click to select a checker, a selected checker will be highlighted in green. After selecting a checker click a square/tile to move to. If the move is a jump, the checker will remain highlighted until the user clicks on it again. It remains highlighted, in case of the user wanting to jump multiple enemy pieces. Error messages for invalid move and clicking on the incorrect checker will be displayed in the UI.
